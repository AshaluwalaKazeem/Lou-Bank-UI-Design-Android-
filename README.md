# Lou-Bank-UI-Design-Android-
This is a Ui design demonstration of a banking application designed with Jetpack Compose. 
It has three screens. 
1. Login Screen.
2. PassCode Screen.
3. Home DashBoard Screen.

To navigate from the login screen to the passcode screen, click either on the "login" button or "become a client of the bank" button.

To navigate from the passCode Screen to the home dashboard screen, click on the "can not login?" text button. 
This will display an AlertDialog. Then click on the "Demo mode" text button on the AlertDialog to navigate to the dashboard screen.
